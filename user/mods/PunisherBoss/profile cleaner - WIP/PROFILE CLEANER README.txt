This batch file will replace all references to punisherboss and punishergear in your profile.json


bosspunisher references will be replaced with bosskilla (killed by, victims, etc)
punisher_rig will be replaced with a Triton in your inventory and stash
punisher_slick will be replaced with the Trooper armor in your inventory and stash
punisher_bag will be replaced with a Pilgrim in your inventory and stash

To use this script:

1. BACKUP YOUR MAIN PROFILE.JSON! Always ensure you have a copy stashed somewhere in case all else fails lol.

2. Place a COPY of your main profile.json from users/profile/[youruniqueid].json into punisherboss/profilecleaner
	
	-Ensure this is a new copy and NOT your backup we made in step 1

3. Run uninstall.bat

4. Ensure the script work by searching for "punisher" in the new profile.json. The only references that may be there will be the actual mod entries, which will be removed upon next boot. As long as you don't see bosspunisher, punisher_rig, punisher_bag, or punisher_slick your profile will now be cleaned of all references!

Enjoy!
